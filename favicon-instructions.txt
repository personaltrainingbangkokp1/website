FAVICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

The HTML is now ready for favicon files. You need to add these files to your root directory:

1. favicon.ico (32x32 or 16x16 pixels)
   - Should be your "P1" logo or a simple "R" for Ramin
   - Save as favicon.ico in the root folder

2. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)
   - Higher resolution version for iOS devices
   - Save as apple-touch-icon.png in the root folder

You can create these from your existing logo using:
- Online tools like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
- Or any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)

Once added, your site will show your logo in browser tabs and bookmarks.
