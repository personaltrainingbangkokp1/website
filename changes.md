- update testimonial with {Ramin is the best trainer I have ever had. He is firm yet kind, he is highly knowledgeable, and he meets me at my level. He keeps a great track of my progress, takes us a step back when I’ve been away for a few weeks and then quickly gets us back to the level I was at before my holiday. We trained in my condo gym when I lived in Bangkok, and we kept training via video when I moved to Europe. Over the past eight years we’ve become great friends, and our sessions together are a highlight in my week. We can talk about anything (he is a philosophy buff!) and we laugh a lot, but when I’m tired or don’t feel like talking he will give me space. Highly recommended!

Two years ago, I was suffering from chronic back pain when a friend recommended, I start training with Ramin to strengthen my core and improve my mobility. I decided to give it a try and I’m so glad I did. It’s truly life-changing to finally be pain-free and fully functional. Even though we only train online (as I live in the Netherlands and he’s based in Thailand), every session feels just as effective as in-person training. Ramin designs full-body programs that target exactly what I need, especially core strength and hip mobility. We’ve even converted a room in my home into a mini gym, and I couldn’t be happier with his services. Each session leaves me feeling stronger, more mobile, pain-free, and genuinely happier. I highly recommend Ramin to anyone looking to improve their quality of life, no matter where in the world they are.

I’ve been training with Ramin for over 7 years now, and he’s helped me become the fittest and strongest I’ve ever been. I feel more energized throughout the day, and for the first time in my life, I look forward to working out, something that never happened before training with him. Ramin is reliable, punctual, and always brings a positive attitude. I highly recommend him to anyone who wants to enjoy their workouts while getting real, lasting results.

I first started training with Ramin twice a week while living in Bangkok. Although I had always been active in sports like football, golf, and tennis, I had never done any structured strength training. I frequently get injured and often felt weak and tired. My wife, who was also training with Ramin at the time, suggested I try strength training with him, and I’m so glad I did.
In the beginning, I struggled with fatigue and low strength levels, but within just a few weeks, the exercises started to feel easier, and I began noticing real progress. That’s when I truly understood the benefits and became motivated to train regularly.
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, we seamlessly transitioned to online sessions, which allowed me to stay consistent under Ramin’s expert guidance. Even after moving back to France, I’ve continued training with him online. I’m completely satisfied with his services and would highly recommend Ramin to anyone looking to get in shape, build strength, and enjoy the process.
